# The Age of Dungeon Breaks

_(Established History of the World)_

> _In a distant future, when the gods lay upon their deathbeds, mana was left without restraint. It ran free, as if the land itself refused to walk quietly into that good night._

With divine order failing, raw mana surged unchecked. It flowed and pooled across the world, gathering where it could not escape. Where mana accumulated, the land began to warp. Forests twisted. Stone softened and reformed. Beasts and people alike were changed—not gradually, but almost overnight—as though a new world had been painted over the old.

This event came to be known as a **Dungeon Break**—the first recorded instance in history of a **Living Dungeon**.

## Dungeon Break (Formal Definition)

**Dungeon Break**  
_A warping or mutation of a location caused by the unnatural pooling of raw mana._

When mana accumulates beyond a stable threshold, the affected area begins to:

- Rewrite its environment and ecosystem
- Alter local physical and magical laws
- Produce predatory or hostile conditions
- Resist permanent habitation

In rare instances, locations already saturated with death, emotion, or bloodshed —such as mass grave sites, battlefields, or major hunting grounds—can trigger **localized Dungeon Breaks** when exposed to raw mana.

These smaller manifestations are known as **Dungates** _(working title)_.

Dungates are unstable and often temporary.  
True Dungeon Breaks are **regional, persistent, and self-sustaining**.

## The First Dungeon Break: Yamir

The first confirmed Dungeon Break occurred in **Yamir**, the City of Sin—a sprawling metropolis of indulgence, excess, and unchecked desire. Later scholars often compare Yamir to mythic cities such as Sodom or legendary pleasure-states.

Yamir was not destroyed.

It was **rewritten**.

The city became what is now known as **the Scarlet Forest**—a living biome where:

- Plants lure prey through scent, color, and false comfort
- Beasts deceive rather than pursue
- The environment itself participates in predation

Nothing of Yamir remains except what the forest allows to endure.

## The Age of Collapse

After Yamir, Dungeon Breaks multiplied.

City after city fell—not to war or famine, but to mana saturation they neither understood nor could prevent. Civilization fractured as the world transformed into a patchwork of unstable, living regions.

This era is remembered as the **Age of Collapse**.

## Maru Quicksilver & the Discovery of Flow

Survival came not through resistance, but **redirection**.

Maru Quicksilver discovered that Dungeon Breaks could be prevented by tapping into **ley-lines** and actively drawing mana away before it could pool. By maintaining continuous flow, the likelihood of a Dungeon Break was drastically reduced.

Mana, she argued, was not corruptive by nature.  
It was **stagnation** that destroyed cities.

Her discovery came too late.

Before her findings could be shared with the greater world, nearly every remaining city fell.

Only one endured.

## Gulthinder, Last City of Humanity

**Gulthinder** survived because it adapted.

Built atop a ley-line nexus, the city constructed a massive **Mana Engine** to regulate and channel mana safely away from accumulation points. The engine not only prevented Dungeon Breaks, but also powered the city’s infrastructure and **arcano-technology**. In function, it is often compared to nuclear power: immensely productive, tightly regulated, and catastrophic if mismanaged.

As the surrounding world destabilized, Gulthinder raised a vast wall to protect its people from the ever-expanding frontier of Living Dungeons.

For six years, the city endured.

---

## The Pathfinders & the Bracers Guild

In the early years of Gulthinder’s survival, scouts were sent beyond the walls in an attempt to find a cure for Dungeon Breaks. These individuals became known as **Pathfinders**.

Through them, much was learned about the unstable lands surrounding the city. However, no method was ever discovered to reverse a Dungeon Break once it had fully formed.

With the aid of the Pathfinders, Maru Quicksilver attempted to develop **mobile Mana Engines** capable of channeling mana in unstable regions. The dangers proved too great. Too many were lost.

The project was abandoned.

The Pathfinder Order was disbanded and its remaining members reorganized into a city-wide defensive force known as the **Bracers Guild**, tasked with internal security and emergency response.

By order of the city council, Maru Quicksilver was confined to maintaining the central Mana Engine to keep Gulthinder standing for as long as possible.

---

## Dungates Within the Wall

Since the construction of the wall, there have been rare but alarming reports of **Dungates forming inside the city**.

These incidents are treated as extreme emergencies.

Bracers who enter these Dungates report sensations consistent with being **transported elsewhere entirely**. Survivors consistently describe environments matching regions far beyond the wall. Current theory suggests these Dungates are **ley-line overlaps**, where distant mana-saturated regions intersect with stable space along the same ley-line.

---

## Control of the Mana Engine

While the Mana Engine is the invention of **Dr. Maru Quicksilver**, ownership and regulatory control were seized by the city council as a matter of survival.

Security and containment of the Mana Engine complex fall under the authority of the **Bracers Guild**.

Should the engine fail, the resulting **Mana Recoil** would not only annihilate Gulthinder, but trigger a Dungeon Break of unprecedented scale—one capable of reshaping the world beyond anything previously recorded.

---

## The Present Crisis

Six years after the wall’s completion, Gulthinder faces a new threat.

Its reserves are dwindling.  
Resource projections show collapse within months.

In response, the council activates the **Pathfinder Protocol**.

All citizens holding civil stations are evaluated, reassigned, and mobilized. Exploration, recovery, and frontier engagement are no longer forbidden.

They are necessary.

**This is where the campaign begins.**
