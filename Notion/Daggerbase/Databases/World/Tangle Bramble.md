  Spend a Fear to choose a target and spotlight all Tangle Brambles within Close range of them. Those Minions move into Melee range of the target and make one shared attack roll. On a success, they deal 2 physical damage each. Combine this damage.

  Drain and Multiply - Reaction: 
  When an attack from the Bramble causes a target to mark HP and there are three or more Tangle Bramble Minions within Close range, you can combine the Minions into a Tangle Bramble Swarm Horde. The Horde’s HP is equal to the number of Minions combined.
