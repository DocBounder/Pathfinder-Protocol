## Maru Quicksilver & the Discovery of Flow
![[Maru Quicksilver.jpg|250]]
Survival came not through resistance, but **redirection**.

Maru Quicksilver discovered that Dungeon Breaks could be prevented by tapping into **ley-lines** and actively drawing mana away before it could pool. By maintaining continuous flow, the likelihood of a Dungeon Break was drastically reduced.

Mana, she argued, was not corruptive by nature.  
It was **stagnation** that destroyed cities.

Her discovery came too late.

Before her findings could be disseminated to the wider world, nearly every remaining city fell.

Only one endured.
