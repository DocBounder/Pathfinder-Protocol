In a time far in the future when the gods lay on their death beds mana ran free, as if the land refused to walk into that good night. This is when it happened, mana uncontrolled raw flowed and pooled, the land began to warp and beast and man mutated as if almost over night a new landscape hand been painted. This event was come to be known as a dungeon break. And the first instance in recorded history of a living dungeon 

Dungeon Break: A warping or muting of a place due to the unnatural pooling of mana in a location. In rare instances things like mass grave sites, battlefields, animal hunting grounds, etc. when coupled with raw mana have also been known to create localized instances of a Dungeon Break know as a Dun-gate (working title)

The First dungeon break to place in Yamir the city of sin (think Vegas or Sodom and Gamora) It was warped into what is not know as the scarlet forest a place where the plants and beast are known for luring in their prey before devouring them 

As time went on city after city broke, until one women discovered a way to survive. Maru Quicksilver discovered that if one could tap into a lay-line and draw out the mana to stop it from pooling one could drastically lower the chances of a dungeon break. But time was not on her side as before the could share her findings with the greater world the city of Gulthinder was the last surrounded by a wild frontier 

Using the mana engine to not only power the city, but its Arcano-tech as well. (I think this would be akin to necular power for DnD) Soon Gulthinder began to construct a wall to protect its people as the fast expanse grew ever more dangerous. 6 years later and the city finds itself in a crisis of a resource shortage. Initiating the pathfinder protocol, all members of civil stations within Gulthinder were evaluated and reassigned and we start the campaign there

In the beginning of the cities history, scouts were sent out to attempt to find a cure for the Dungeon Breaks, these individuals would become known as pathfinders. Much was learned about the new lands that surrounded them but no way to to reverse the changes already made. Maru with the help of the pathfinders attempted to create a mobile version of the Mana engine to attempt to channel the energy of the other zones but with the dangers ever present implementing this became to dangerous and the pathfinders were disbanded and repurposed as city wide protectors known as the Bracers Guild. Maru as ordered by the council was to maintain the Mana Engine to keep the city standing for as long as possible

Since the construction of the wall, there have been rare but alarming reports of **Dungates forming inside the city**.

These incidents are treated as extreme emergencies.

Bracers who enter these Dungates report that the experience resembles being **transported elsewhere entirely**. Survivors consistently describe environments matching regions far beyond the wall. Current theory suggests that Dungates are connections to other areas tied to the same ley-line, where distant mana-saturated regions overlap with spaces along the same line.

While the Mana engine is an invention of Dr. Quicksilver the council has seized ownership and regulatory control of the engine as a necessity to the survival of the city, It falls into the duty of the bracers guild to maintain security around the mana engine complex. should the engine fail the Mana Recoil would not only decimate the city of Gulthinder but would cause a Dungeon Break the likes the world has never seen.
