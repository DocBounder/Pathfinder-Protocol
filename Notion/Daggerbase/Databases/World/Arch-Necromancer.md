  Mark 2 Stress to cause all targets within Far range to make a Strength Reaction Roll. Targets who fail take 2d20+12 magic damage and you gain a Fear. Targets who succeed take half damage. A target who marks 2 or more HP must also mark 2 Stress and becomes Vulnerable until they roll with Hope.

  Open the Gates of Death - Action: 
  Spend a Fear to summon a Zombie Legion, which appears at Close range and immediately takes the spotlight.

  Not Today, My Dears - Reaction: 
  When the Necromancer has marked 7 or more of their HP, you can spend a Fear to have them teleport away to a safe location to recover. A PC who succeeds on an Instinct Roll can trace the teleportation magic to their destination.

  Your Demise is Near - Reaction: 
  Countdown (2d6). When the Necromancer has marked 6 or more of their HP, activate the countdown. When it triggers, deal 2d10+6 direct magic damage to a target within Close range. The Necromancer then clears a number of Stress or HP equal to the number of HP marked by the target from this attack.
